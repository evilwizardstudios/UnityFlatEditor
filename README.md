# FlatEditor for Unity


FlatEditor is an attempt to port (at least a lot) of Bootstrap to the Unity Editor. Judging from some of 5's styling it might be better for Asset authors to have tools like these sooner rather than later. 

Honestly, right now, it's just up here if anyone wants to take a look at it. I'll actually start to dig in on this in early 2016.
