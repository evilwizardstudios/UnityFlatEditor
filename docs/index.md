## About Flat Editor
  Flat Editor is an open-source UI framework for the Unity Game Engine Editor.
  It's designed primarily for Asset developers, but it's for everyone who wants it.

  Flat Editor is a <span style='text-decoration:line-through'>blatant ripoff</span>
  *homage* to [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com). As  such attempts to implement
  and build off of Bootstrap's functionality as much as possible.

## Support Flat Editor
  Flat Editor is open-source, under the
  [GNU General Public License v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt). The
  absolute best way to  support Flat Editor is to contribute!

  [Github Repository](https://github.com/evilwizardstudios/UnityFlatEditor)

  Fix it, clean it up, fork it and hack on it -- do whatever, just
  [follow the GPL conditions](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)

  (disclose the source, note changes, and keep the GPL, basically).

  Better and easier-to-build Asset UI means better easier-to-use Unity Assets,
  and that means better games, and everyone generally just has a better time and
  more fun.

  If you like Flat Editor and want to show your support (but don't have the time
  to contribute) consider buying me a coffee and I will do my best to turn that
  caffeine into useful code:
